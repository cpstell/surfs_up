# Surfs_Up_Analysis

## Resources

- Data Tools: PostgreSQL, PgAdmin, and SQLite
- Data Source: Surfsup_Challenge.sql

## Overview of the analysis

W. Avy wants to open and run an ice cream store in Oahu. He is unsure if the temperatures in that area will be conducive to being able to sell ice cream year-round. He wants to know the temperature data for the months of June and December in order to make a sound decision.

## Methodology

- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

## Results

The above image tells us three facts about the temperatures in June:

- The average temperature observed was 74.9° F
- The lowest temperature observed was 64° F
- The highest temperature observed was 85° F

![dec_temp_summary_stats](./image/dec_temp_summary_stats.png)

The above image tells us three facts about the temperatures in December:

- The average temperature observed was 71° F
- The lowest temperature observed was 56° F
- The highest temperature observed was 83° F

## Summary

For the month of June there were 1500 points of data collected and for the month of December there were 1517 point of data collected. Using this data, we can feel confident we have an accurate temperature analysis for both of these months. If we wanted to further our analysis, we can add a query to find the precipitation for both June and December. Then we can combine both the temperature data and the precipitation data to get a better overall picture at how temperature and precipitation will impact W. Avy's ice cream business.
